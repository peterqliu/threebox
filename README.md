# `threebox`

A three.js plugin for Mapbox GL JS, with support for basic animation and advanced 3D rendering.


## Installation

Add it to your project via `npm`:

`npm install threebox`

or download the bundle from [`dist/threebox.js`](dist/threebox.js) and add include it in a `<script>` tag on your page.

## Documentation

### [`Threebox`](/docs/Threebox.md)

Set up and handle the core translations between a Three.js scene graph and the Mapbox GL JS map.


### [`SymbolLayer3D`](/docs/SymbolLayer3D.md)

The `SymbolLayer3D` object lets you load in a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` of points and will automatically place 3D models at each point.


## Features
### Current
These features currently have a dedicated interface in `threebox`.

### Planned
These features should be possible to implement using Three.js today but would benefit from a more geographic/map-specific interface in a future version of `threebox`.
